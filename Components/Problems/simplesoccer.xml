			value="A 2D simulated simplfied robot soccer game. Fitness is evaluated based on a weighted sum. Each player is controlled by an own controller instantiated from the same candidate representation. Thus, the game is a product of a self-organized process. The players receive very limited information on the ongoing game, such as the distance to the ball, the distance to the closest teammate/opponent and some information about the borders.
	Supports 1v1 ranking systems. Does not support absolute fitness." />
